# Nokicode Translator

Nokicode Translator is a basic little tool i made that can translate *English* into *Nokicode*, And also translate it back. 
I Don't know what this can be used for, but it is pretty neat.<br>
<br>
You could use it to send secret messages to your friends i guess, hehe. ðŸ˜€

## What is Nokicode?
Nokicode is a line of numbers that represents letters of the alphabet, some punctuation and a space. 
Each letter is 2 digits, The first one represent a **number button on a nokia phone**, and the second is **the amount of clicks.**
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc23e260-e5a4-468a-b657-b85c6c0cb6f1" style="width:250px; height:250px;"></div>
<br><br>

> the number 0 is meant for spaces, and the number 1 has punctuation: "! ? . ,"

> a single click of each number just inserts the number itself.

So if you want to say "Hello World" in **Nokicode**, you'd say:<bn>

*4333545464029264745432*
<br>

(**43** means a press on the **4** button **3** times, which makes an H. And so on for every 2 numbers...)

## What is a Nokiloop?
a **Nokiloop** is a result of putting **Nokicode** into the **English to Nokicode** Translator, resulting in a more complex nokicode. 
This can be done as many times as you want, this tool also has a translator for that so you can decode it quickly :D
